# Final project - EthStorage

This is my final project for the 2021 Blockchain Developer Bootcamp.

EthStorage is a file storage dApp utilizing IPFS decentralized file storage.

Users are able to upload files to IPFS through the dApp.  Files are assigned to the wallet address used to upload.

Users can only view those files assigned to that wallet address.
