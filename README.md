MOVE Shoes 10k Challenge

For my final project I will develop an NFT for a fictional shoe company called Move Shoes Inc.

Move Shoes will issue a NFT for those who wish to participate in their 10k Challenge.  

Participants must complete a 10K road race in order to claim their prize.

NFT will use the OpenZeppelin ERC721 contracts.

React front end.

NFT.Storage to store the NFT Metadata.

Chainlink Oracles to verify race completion via an external API call.
